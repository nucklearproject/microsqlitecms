          you want to use the caching feature
        * media and images (CHMOD 777) - need to be writable if you want to
          use the file uploader
 3. Ready! You should now be able to access the index page by browsing to the
    address you uploaded phpSQLiteCMS (e.g.
    http://your-domain.tld/path/to/phpsqlitecms/). To administrate the page,
    go to http://your-domain.tld/path/to/phpsqlitecms/cms/. The default admin
    userdata is: username: admin, password: admin.
